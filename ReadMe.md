One should run the the scripts in the following order:

`'Schritt 1.R`, `'Schritt 2.R`, and lastly `'Schritt 3.R'`.

But all the outputs are saved already for ease of use, that is Step 1 as the three `.rds` files, Step 2 in `/documentation_tables` and Step 3 in `/Rgraphics`, so the scripts can already be run in any order.
